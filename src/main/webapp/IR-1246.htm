<p>The Modern Workstation is the collection of systems and applications that will enhance our daily operations at RBFCU. As many users already have 
experienced with their PCs at home, Windows 10 will upgrade our operating system by making it faster, smoother and more secure. Office 2016 will 
bring us the latest processes with constant-demand applications like Word, Outlook and Excel. Instant messaging will be a click away with Skype For 
Business. And our business processes, invoice attention and workflow will be aided by OnBase 17.</p>

<p>Q: When will Windows 10 and the other elements on The Modern Workstation be on my computer?</p>
<p>A: Rollout of this program will begin in the second quarter of this year. The deployment will start with select groups and departments before 
progressing to larger departments through the third quarter. Final groups will be RMA and branches.</p><br />

<p>Q: Why are the branches being rolled out last?</p>
<p>A: The branches will be the final group so we can better ensure any upgrade issues have been identified and resolved. This will provide the 
smoothest transition possible with the least risk of disruption to our member-facing employees.</p><br />

<p>Q: Will there be mandatory training for use of Windows 10 and the applications?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Training will be offered through University on the RBFCU Intranet, which will be provided in the coming months.</p><br />

<p>Q: If I have questions, who can answer them?</p>
<p>A: Each Business Unit will have “Champions” who will be able to help you with any questions or concerns. In addition, your manager can also 
provide guidance.</p><br />

<p>Q: How will Windows 10 and the rest of The Modern Workstation be better for RBFCU and how will it help us better serve our members?</p>
<p>A: There are four things to consider:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Security improvements to Windows 10 provide better protection for our enterprise data and devices against viruses, malware, and breaches. </li>
    <li>Cost savings through improved hardware performance that will extend the life of existing computers and improved productivity for users.</li>
    <li>Continued improvements to Windows 10 in software updates instead of major version releases from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</li>
    <li>Windows 7 support will soon come to an end. So, if there was no upgrade,  it would lead to increased application and hardware problems, 
    as well as greater security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
<br />

<p>Q: How will this be better for me as a user?</p>
<p>A: We believe there are five improvements:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Improved performance with faster startup speeds, smoother transition between applications, and better overall performance even on older computers. </li>
    <li>Snap Assist makes it easier to view up to four applications on a single screen.</li>
    <li>Start Menu with live tiles that can be arranged, grouped, and resized for quick access. </li>
    <li>Improved search capabilities to help reduce the need to navigate to applications and files.</li>
    <li>Task View makes applications easier to access.</li>

</ol><br />

<p>Q: I have Windows 10 at home. Will this be just like it?</p>
<p>A: Not all features of Windows 10 that you use at home are aligned with RBFCU&apos;s policies and culture. These features will not be available.</p><br />

<p>Q: What if I&apos;m already familiar with Windows 10 and want to help others?</p>
<p>A: Speak with your manager about wanting to be a resource for your team.</p>
